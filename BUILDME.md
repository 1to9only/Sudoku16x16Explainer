# Sudoku16x16Explainer

To build this from source code, you'll need these folders:

- com/formdev/flatlaf
- org/json/simple

from either https://github.com/1to9only/Sukaku6x6Explainer or https://github.com/1to9only/SukakuExplainer.

I've stopped uploading the same files (i.e. third-party stuff) to multiple repositories!
